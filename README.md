## Introduction

Hello, my Name is Hovanes Yementyan. I am in 10th grade and also 15 years old. Some of my hobbies are playing video games and reading thrillers. One of my favorite book series is the Harry Potter books. Recently I have tried to code a game in lua for roblox. One personal milestone I have is getting all A's for 4 years. One fun fact about myself is I like to play board games. My Goal for this year is to get all A's and pass my AP Tests with at least a 4. A place I went to over the summer was Vancouver, Canda and went and explored around the area. Some of my favorite food over the summer was Pizza because it hits different over the summer. I hope to achive a A in this class and get at least a 4 on the AP test. One of the most memorable experiances
